            | My name is 
            span.highlight Mandy 
            |  and I am an 
            span.highlight user experience designer 
            | that enjoys doing 
            span.highlight front end development
            | . I value interfaces that works well in giving users what they expect (and more)! I always enjoy products or services that exceed my expectation. I hope to do the same too! I am interested in designing useful products or services that can satisfy people's unheard needs. This motivates me to continue learning and observing every day. I am enthusiastic and always ready to learn!

          p
            | I am also quite fond of detailed things; animations, paintings, architecture, micro-interactionsike, etc. Little things come together to make a big impact as a whole. SO! details count and shouldn't be overlooked!

          p
            | Recently, I came back from a 4 month exchange in Japan. Although I didn't study design in Japan, I learned a lot from Japanese culture. Learning and questioning their way of doing things made me think a lot about what made my experience in Japan so enjoyable.
