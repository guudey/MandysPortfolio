          <h1 class="project_header">About</h1>
          <p>Active Textbook is an eBook reader that is available on the web, play store and app store.<span class="highlight"> I was assigned to redesign their flagship iOS app to fit current iOS design standards and enhance the product experience for the users.</span> I mainly focused on following Apple’s design guidelines, ensuring the flow of the app was flexible to users’ needs and onboarding for new users using the applications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project_content_div">
          <h1 class="project_header">My Role </h1>
          <p>I did research to gather information about the purpose of Active Textbook and the users’ goal using active textbook. Using this information, I was able to make insightful design decisions on possible actions or flow of actions a user may take using the app. I also analyzed the underperforming parts of the current iOS application and made changes to that. I pitched the changes to my supervisor and the developer explaining my design changes.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Visually it was not appealing because the book covers were uneven and padding was missing around visual elements.</li>
              <li>Unclear indications on bottom nav bar</li>
              <li>Unintuitive interactions within the app</li>
              <li>Unlabeled and unconventional icons used</li>
              <li>Misuse of two navigation bars, one hamburger menu and one bottom navigation</li>

            <h3 class="project_subheader">Research </h3>
            <p>To start off, I <span class="highlight">interviewed people </span>who were responsible for the app, to see where they thought <span class="highlight">existing problems </span>were or where they thought the app could improve.</p>
            <p>I looked into the <span class="highlight">actions </span>a user would take if they were to use the app, or what <span class="highlight">purpose </span>they would have when they are using the app. </p>
            <p>I made mockups using <span class="highlight"> Adobe Illustrator </span> for each screen that was needed from the research.</p>
            <p>Here are some variations of grey scale mockups I did of the same screen to test how the placement of elements would work with each other.</p>

            <h3 class="project_subheader">High Fidelity Mock-ups </h3>
            <p>High fidelity mock-ups are effective for allowing the developer and my supervisor to get a <span class="highlight">better understanding </span>of how the <span class="highlight">visual design and the elements </span>interact with each other in the app.</p>
            <p>After every iteration, I would email it to the supervisor and developer. Then a meeting will be held to <span class="highlight">discuss and critique </span>my designs. After the meeting, I would go back and make changes to the mockups and present them again.</p>
            <p>Here are examples of high fidelity mockups of both iphones and ipads</p>

          <h3 class="project_subheader">Iterations</h3>
          <p>After finishing the mockups, I presented it to my co-worker and supervisor. We would discuss what we could iterate upon. During discussion, some difficulties arrived when we had different opinions for the app's features. </p>
          <p>Specifically, <span class="highlight">how the user will be able to find more information about the book in cover view. </span>I came up with a few solutions for the supervisor to choose from, but the supervisor didn’t see the need to change the way book details were being accessed -- which was the floating green 'i' icon.</p>

        <div class="project_content_div project_img_div"><img class="project_img" src="img/atb/high_mockup1.jpg" alt="redesigned cover view">

        <div class="project_content_div project_text_div">
          <h3 class="project_subheader">Solution </h3>
          <p>In the end, I continued to iterate on the design and convinced my supervisor on a solution that we were both happy with. Instead of having a floating icon, the user can <span class="highlight">access details about the book through a long press on the book</span>. However, the user won’t be able to know about this action without instructions, therefore, I added onboarding to the app.</p>

            <h1 class="project_header">Take away </h1>
            <p>By adding onboarding to the Active Textbook, new users will be able to learn about how to use the reader. Active Textbook is updated to modern standards of design and allows for a smooth user experience for their readers. This will increase value not only for the readers but for Evident Point. When users feel happy and in control using Active Textbook, they will continue using it and even recommend it to their friends, increasing their user base. </p>
