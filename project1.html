          <p>I worked at a software company called<span class="highlight"> Evident Point</span> as a UX Designer. They asked me to <span class="highlight">re-design their iOS app </span> to make it more "app-like".</p>

          <h1 class="project_header">My Role </h1>
          <p>This was an <span class="highlight">individual project</span>, I did all the research and design myself. I went to my co-workers to get information and insight about the existing applications to further my research.</p>

            <h1 class="project_header">Analysis</h1>
            <p>The reason the app wasn’t “app-like” was because it the book covers were not <span class="highlight">uniform </span>. Also, the elements on the app is <span class="highlight">missing white space or padding.</span></p>
            <p>Another reason is that some interactions don’t actually exist in iOS therefore, it looks weird in the app. Like the floating information icon on the book covers. </p>
            <p>However, the app's <span class="highlight">main problem </span>was that it's not user friendly as a lot of the <span class="highlight">interactions </span>were <span class="highlight">not intuitive or clear</span>. Like the navigation bar at the bottom, blue was used to highlight the selected tab on a green navigation bar. Or the combination of using a hamburger menu and a bottom navigation bar.</p>

          <p>To start off, I <span class="highlight">talked to people </span>who are responsible for the app, to see where they thought <span class="highlight">existing problems </span>were or where they thought the app could improve.</p>
          <p>
             Then I looked into the <a class="highlight" href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/">design guidelines of apple.</a> In attempts to make it more “app-like” and to learn apple’s design language.</p>

            <p>I looked into the <span class="highlight">actions </span>a user would take if they were to use the app, or what <span class="highlight">purpose </span>they would have when they are using the app. </p>
            <p>I made mockups using <span class="highlight"> Adobe Illustrator </span> for each screen that was needed from the research.</p>
            <p>Here are some variations of grey scale mockups I did of the same screen to test how the placement of elements would work with each other.</p>

            <p>High fidelity mock-ups are effective for allowing the developer and my supervisor to get a <span class="highlight">better understanding </span>of how the <span class="highlight">visual design and the elements </span>interact with each other in the app.</p>
            <p>After every iteration, I would email it to the supervisor and developer. Then a meeting will be held to <span class="highlight">discuss and critique </span>my designs. After the meeting, I would go back and make changes to the mockups and present them again.</p>
            <p>Here are examples of high fidelity mockups of both iphones and ipads</p>

          <p>After finishing the mockups, I presented it to my co-worker and supervisor. We would discuss what we could be iterate upon. There were some difficulties with discussing the features in the app.</p>
          <p>Specifically, <span class="highlight">how the user will be able to find more information about the book in cover view. </span>I came up with a few solutions, but the supervisor didn’t find the need to change the way book details was being accessed.</p>

        <div class="project_content_div project_text_div">
          <h3 class="project_subheader">Solution </h3>
          <p>In the end, I kept iterating upon the design and convinced my supervisor on a solution that we were both happy with. Instead of having a floating icon, the user can <span class="highlight">access details about the book through a long press on the book</span>. However, the user won’t be able to know about this action without instructions, therefore, I added onboarding to the app.</p>

            <h1 class="project_header">Take away </h1>
            <p>I <span class="highlight">wasn't completely happy </span>with the solution of adding an onboarding to let the user know the interactions needed to access parts of the app, because <span class="highlight">not all people read or go through the onboarding</span>. So they can actually miss the information. Also, onboarding can also be a lot of information to intake at once for the user, therefore I don't think it is the best solution, but it is a solution that my employer agreed to, to keep the design I made.</p>
