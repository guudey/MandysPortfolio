            <p>The font and other styled elements was inspired from modern coffee shops and their websites. </p>
            <p>We wanted the website to give off a <span class="highlight">clean, vibrant look </span>along with being professional and not too playful. Thus, the photos in the website has to be bright, colourful and vibrant. The background of the website is white to give off the clean feel. </p>

          <p>With the first iteration, there was still a lot unsure elements in the website. For example, the nav bar at the top has weird alignment. </p>
          <p>
             The menu items has a image underlay which makes the text hard to read. The layout organization could be improved upon as well, as it was confusing that all the menus were just listed in a 3x3 grid.</p>

          <p>At school, our website was <span class="highlight">critiqued </span>and <span class="highlight">tested in many ways</span>. For example it was test for: responsiveness, load time, functional without Javascript, and feeling of security for the user. </p>
          <p>Feedback on our website was relatively positive, but there was a few critique and we took to improve on our website.</p>

          <p>From the critique, I felt that our order forms was lacking legitimacy. I implemented a process bar to show progress in the order form.</p>
          <p>But the form was <span class="highlight">still lacking</span>. I tried discussing with my partner to try to figure out what was missing. </p>

            <p>I went through a purchase process on STEAM, a online platform that sells games. From that, I screenshotted and analyzed what made me feel “safe” or what made the purchase process feel legitimate. </p>
            <p>I noticed that the form is <span class="highlight">restricted to a certain size</span>and there were <span class="highlight">fine print </span>throughout the form to inform the user in case they felt insecure about something.

          <p>For 7Trades’ order forms, I put in margins so the form was a <span class="highlight">set size</span>, and it instantly made the forms look more legitimate. </p>

            <p>I learned from this experience that I should look at <span class="highlight">exisiting examples </span>for reference and see what the <span class="highlight">standards</span>. It is important for to make the user feel safe when going through an order forms because <span class="highlight">without the feeling of safety </span>they <span class="highlight">may not </span>make the purchase on the website.</p>
            <p>To continue iterating on the website I would put in more fine print throughout the order forms to create even more security for the user.</p>
