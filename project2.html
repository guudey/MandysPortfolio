              <p>The font and other styled elements was inspired from modern coffee shops and their websites. </p>
              <p>We wanted the website to give off a clean vibrant look along with being professional and not too playful. Thus, the photos in the website has to be bright, colourful and vibrant. The background of the website is white to give off the clean feel. </p>

            <p>
               The menu items has a image underlay which makes the text hard to read. The layout organization could be improved upon as well, as it was confusing that all the menus were just listed in a 3x3 grid.</p>

            <p>At school, our website was tested and critiqued in many ways. For example it was test for: responsiveness, load time, functional without Javascript, and feeling of security for the user. </p>
            <p>Feedback on our website was relatively positive, but there was a few critique and we took to improve on our website.</p>

            <p>But the form was still lacking. I tried discussing with my partner to try to figure out what was missing. </p>

              <h3 class="project_subheader">Analysis </h3>
              <p>I went through a purchase process on STEAM, a online platform that sells games. From that, I screenshotted and analyzed what made me feel “safe” or what made the purchase process feel legitimate. </p>
              <p>I noticed that the form is restricted to a certain size, there were fine print throughout the form to inform the user in case they felt insecure about something. They specifically let the user know when they were purchasing.  </p>

            <p>For 7Trades’ order process, I put in margins so the form was a set size, and it instantly made the forms look more legitimate. </p>

              <p>I learned from this experience that I should look at real life examples for references and see what the standards are for any process. As it is important for to make the user feel safe when going through an order process.</p>
