            p
              | The reason the app wasn’t “app-like” was because it the book covers were not 
              span.highlight uniform 
              | . Also, the elements on the app is 
              span.highlight missing white space or padding.
            p
              | Another reason is that some interactions don’t actually exist in iOS therefore, it looks weird in the app. Like the floating information icon on the book covers. 
            p
              | However, the app's 
              span.highlight main problem 
              | was that it's not user friendly as a lot of the 
              span.highlight interactions 
              | were 
              span.highlight not intuitive or clear
              | . Like the navigation bar at the bottom, blue was used to highlight the selected tab on a green navigation bar. Or the combination of using a hamburger menu and a bottom navigation bar.

            span.highlight how the user will be able to find more information about the book in cover view.

            span.highlight access details about the book through a long press on the book
            | . However, the user won’t be able to know about this action without instructions, therefore, I added onboarding to the app.

              span.highlight wasn't completely happy 
              | with the solution of adding an onboarding to let the user know the interactions needed to access parts of the app, because 
              span.highlight not all people read or go through the onboarding
              | . So they can actually miss the information. Also, onboarding can also be a lot of information to intake at once for the user, therefore I don't think it is the best solution, but it is a solution that my employer agreed to, to keep the design I made.
