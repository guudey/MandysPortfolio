            <h3 class="project_subheader">Selecting an Opportunity </h3>
            <p>Between the three choices, we decided to go with  <span class="highlight">integrating a music feature. </span>This is because Strava lacks a music feature that a lot of their competitors already have. </p>
            <p>These days, people mainly use streaming services to access music. It doesn't make sense for Strava to make their own music service because it will take away from the purpose of the app, to track running / cycling routines. Therefore, <span class="highlight">collborating with a music streaming service </span>is probably best for Strava. In this case, we decided to collaborate Strava with<span class="highlight">Spotify.</span></p>
            <p>However, implementing a music playing feature doesn't give enough value to stand out from their competitors. A music feature that can provide users useful information about their run/cycle corresponding to the music they listened to will allow users to see how to keep up a consistent pace during their run/cycle!</p>

            <p>To seamlessly integrate Spotify into Strava, we looked at the current app to see where we can implement Spotify. We tried our best to use existing layouts to keep consistent with Strava. Such as Figure 2.</p>
            <p>In Figure 3 and 4, is where the music feature is implemented; creating a playlist and choosing the playlist for the run/cycle.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in Figure 5, it shows the progress of your run in correlation to the songs the user listened to during their run/cycle.</p>

            <p>Although our goal was to not turn Strava into a music app and mainly focus on being a running app, we made Strava have a very large section explicitly for music. </p>
            <p>When we realized this, we knew we had to change and rethink on how we want to execute the music feature without being too overpowering.</p>

            <p>When people first access Spotify within Strava, they will be greeted to login to Spotify to access the information on Spotify, as demonstrated in Figure 6.</p>
            <p>
               Instead of making a playlist on Strava, people will be have to pre-make their playlists on Spotify to be synced with Strava. They can also choose to sync stations that they are already following on Spotify.</p>

          <p>By implementing Spotify into Strava this way, users will be able to listen to music seamlessly while tracking their run/cycle. Strava also remains being a fitness app and users can see how the songs they listened to affect their performance. </p>
          <p>The push for Strava users to make playlists on Spotify is a good incentive for Spotify to collaborate with Strava. Strava users will be introduced to Spotify through their app, and Spotify users can gain exposure to Strava by promoting healthy lifestyles for their customers.</p>

          <p>The IDEO research methods gave really good insights on Strava. Although more time to ask a larger group of people for the Extreme User Survey would have been more beneficial to get rid of the outliers in the group.</p>
          <p>This project is viable and beneficial for both companies. A problem that could surface is what if Strava were to partner with other streaming companies like Apple Music or Pandora?  </p>
