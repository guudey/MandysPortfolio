          p
            | Strava is an application that track’s an athlete’s running/cycling time and distance travelled. We researched Strava’s position in the market and used IDEO research methods to better understand the app and how the app was being used. By understanding Strava better, 
            span.highlight we decided to partner Strava with Spotify
            | , a music streaming app, 
            span.highlight to implement a music element into Strava. 
            | The music element will be useful and valuable for Strava users during and after their run/cycle as it will be more convenient for them while providing insightful information.

            | I conducted research using IDEO research methods. My partner and I then came together to discuss and compare our findings. After deciding Strava should implement a music feature, I sketched, made grey scale mockups and high fidelity mockups successfully implementing Spotify into Strava.

          p We decided to go with

          p
            | These days, people mainly use streaming services to access music. It doesn't make sense for Strava to make their own music service because it will take away from the purpose of the app, to track running / cycling routines. Therefore, 
            span.highlight collborating with a music streaming service 
            | is probably best for Strava. In this case, we decided to collaborate Strava with
            span.highlight Spotify.
          p
            | However, implementing a music playing feature doesn't give enough value to stand out from their competitors. A music feature that can provide users useful information about their run/cycle corresponding to the music they listened to will allow users to see how to keep up a consistent pace during their run/cycle!

              | To seamlessly integrate Spotify into Strava, we looked at the current app to see where we can implement Spotify. We tried our best to use existing layouts to keep consistent with Strava. Such as Figure 2.

              | Lastly, in Figure 5, it shows the progress of your run in correlation to the songs the user listened to during their run/cycle. Again, keeping consistent with graphics that already exist in the app.

            p
              | Although our goal was to not turn Strava into a music app and mainly focus on being a running app, we made Strava have a very large section explicitly for music. For example, users would have been able to create playlists and choose certain songs, albuns, artists, stations to play from. When we realized this, we knew we had to change and rethink on how we want to execute the music feature without being too overpowering.
            p
              | When people first access Spotify within Strava, they will be greeted to login to Spotify to access the information on Spotify. Instead of making a playlist on Strava, people will be have to pre-make their playlists on Spotify to be synced with Strava. They can also choose to sync stations that they are already following on Spotify.

          p
            | By implementing Spotify into Strava this way, users will be able to listen to music seamlessly while tracking their run/cycle. Strava also remains being a fitness app and users can see how the songs they listened to affect their performance. 
          p
            | The push for Strava users to make playlists on Spotify is a good incentive for Spotify to collaborate with Strava. Strava users will be introduced to Spotify through their app, and Spotify users can gain exposure to Strava by promoting healthy lifestyles for their customers.

          p
            | The IDEO research methods gave really good insights on Strava. Although more time to ask a larger group of people for the Extreme User Survey would have been more beneficial to recieve more feedback and painpoints of Strava.
          p
            | This project is viable and beneficial for both companies because Strava customers will get exposure to Spotify and get an incentive to use Spotify as it is needed for Strava. Spotify users that have the ambition to become more fit will have an incentive to get more fit by using Strava. This collaboration will give exposure to the audience about the respective companies, which will mean more people using both applications, and in turn higher revenue for both companies.
